# Hi there 👋 I am Jaime Gabriels
## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

### Forensic Scientist Turned DevOps Engineer 🔬 ➡️ ⚙️

Successfully transitioned from 15+ years in forensic DNA analysis to DevOps engineering, bringing unique chain-of-custody and compliance expertise to infrastructure automation. 🚀

## About Me

With extensive experience in forensic analysis and business leadership, I've successfully built production DevOps infrastructure serving live applications. My unique background in regulated laboratory environments provides invaluable perspective on compliance, documentation, and audit-ready systems.

**Background:** 15+ years in forensic biology with the South African Police Service Forensic Science Lab, currently at LabScientific DNA paternity testing lab while building production DevOps infrastructure processing 120+ samples/hour through automated pipelines.
